    <h2>The Ice King is a misunderstood Wizard from the land of Ooo. He used to be a normal man, although when he discovered a powerful crown and wore it, he began to get visions and his mind started to corrupt. Through the powers gained from the crown, he managed to survive through the apocalypse. Even though he survived, his mind suffered alot and he is now a crazed wizard capturing princesses. In the apocalypse he met a little girl named Marceline, he raised her alone until he wasn't able to control his powers and left her on her own. Many years pass and the apocalypse ends, with it emerging different races such as candy people and even slime people. He forgot most of whats happened over the years and doesn't even remember Marceline. All this came from the crown. Even though he was trying to protect all the people he loved with the crowns powers, he ended up hurting and therefore isolated himself in the Land of Ice. There he lives with many penguin, his favorite being Günter. His arch enemy is Finn and Jake because they always thwart his plans when he tries kidnapping princesses. Throughout the series, Ice King becomes more friendly with the two, although his evil thoughts are always there.  </h2>
